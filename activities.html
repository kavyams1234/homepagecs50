            <summary><b>Basketball</b></summary>
            <p>On weekends, I like to play pickup games of basketball with my little brother.</p>
            <p>My favorite basketball team is the <cite>Orlando Magic.</cite></p>

            <summary><b>Video games</b></summary>
            <p>I wouldn't classify myself as a gamer, but occasionally, I like to play the PS4.</p>
            <p>My favorite games are NBA 2k (no surprise there) and Rocket League.</p>
            <p>By far, my favorite mobile game is Clash Royale.</p>

        <details>
            <summary><b>Cards</b></summary>
            <p>After coming to Harvard, I've spent a lot of late nights playing cards with friends.</p>
            <p>Friends and I usually play a six-player game called Fish.</p>
            <p>Not to be confused with Go Fish, Fish requires a fair amount of skill and strategy.</p>
